# DevBoardPilot_H743VIT6
An attempt to create an ArduPilot autopilot based on the development board on the STM32H743VIT6 microcontroller.

17.10.21.
Developed based on ArduPilot: https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot
To begin with, a schematic diagram of the autopilot is drawn up, taking into account additional sensors and sensors installed on the main board.
Also, in the STM32Cube program, the microcontroller is configured in order to use everything that is possible without conflicts on the processor buses.
